# IoThingzBot

## About
Workshop Version:  Beta (March 2016)

Inspired--or perhaps troubled by--[Amazon's Dash button](http://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button), which promises that you'll "never miss a beat" in the rhythms of consumption, this workshop seeks to cultivate literacy and agency in the emergent ecosystem of the "Internet of Things."

Specifically, we will leverage the physical computing simulation capabilities of [Autodesk's 123D Circuits](https://123d.circuits.io) and the web-based broker [IFTTT.com](http://ifttt.com) to create a Dash-like device that pleas on Twitter for the cloud to satisfy its most urgent desires for THINGZ.
